# autoLoginImproved
## Applescript to automatically login me into internal college network on detecting LAN connection

This is the improved version which listens to ping instead of cable and uses javascript to enter login details instead of keystrokes. This results in speedy and hassle free connections with zero dialoge boxes.

The command to load and unload the scripts have been updated
--> chmod u+x ~/PATH/TO/netImprovedLoad.command
and 
-- > chmod u+x ~/PATH/TO/netImprovedUnload.command
