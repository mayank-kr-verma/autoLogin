# autoLoginImproved
## Applescript to automatically login me into internal college network on detecting LAN connection

This is the improved version which listens to ping instead of cable. This results in hassle free connections and no dialoge boxes.

The command to load and unload the scripts have been updated
--> chmod u+x ~/PATH/TO/netImprovedLoad.command
and 
-- > chmod u+x ~/PATH/TO/netImprovedUnload.command
