## Applescript to automatically login me into internal college network on detecting LAN connection

This applescript keeps in background and wait for my lan cable to be connected. On connection, it fires up Safari after showing a countdown to give time to system to establish connection. Script then opens the login page of my college and enters id and password and after logging me in, shuts down safari.
On disconnecting the cable it shows a dialogue box and then again waits for lan cable to be connected

The commands to load and unload the script are given in net.txt
